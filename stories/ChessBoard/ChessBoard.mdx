# ChessBoard Component

The `ChessBoard` component displays a chessboard and manages chess piece interactions for the Minotaur chess application. It leverages the Minotaur chess engine and offers support for checked state and piece movement.

## Usage

The `ChessBoard` component requires a `boardArray` and a `movePiece` handler as inputs. It also accepts configurations for custom behavior, such as setting specific pieces in check.

```tsx
<ChessBoard
  boardArray={emptyBoard}
  blackKingCheck={false}
  whiteKingCheck={true} // White king in check state
  movePiece={(piece, xFrom, yFrom, xTo, yTo) =>
    console.log(`Moving piece ${piece} from (${xFrom}, ${yFrom}) to (${xTo}, ${yTo})`)
  }
  config={minotaurConfig}
/>
```

<Primary />
